### File/Process Descriptions ###

1) Randomly generate DATA set for 10000 NACA-4 airfoils with three parameters, and the air velocity,
   and the angle of attack:
	- Number describing max camber as a percentage of the chord
	- Number describing the distance of maximum camber from the airfoil 
	  leading edge in tens of percents of the chord
	- Number describing maximum thickness of the airfoil as percent of the chord
	- Velocity of the air moving past the foil
	- Angle of attack for the foil
2) Generate MESHES for each of the airfoils from the DATA description of each airfoil from (1)
3) Use OpenFOAM to generate the lift coefficient DATA for each airfoil
	 using the MESHES from (2) and the air velocity and angle from (1)
4) Use the DATA from (1) and (3) to train/test a Tensorflow/Keras Sequential Neural Network
	to predict lift coefficient from the three NACA, air velocity, and angle of attack parameters

1) generateFoilData.cpp
2) generateFoils.cpp
3) openFoamRuns.sh
4) nn.r
